# scheduler

Scheduler is your daily 9-5 calendar. Helps organize your tasks via hour blocks that are color coded for past, present, and future time.

# Roadmap

To continue on with the project, I will scale the scheduler so that it can be used for weekly and monthly events.

# Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

# Acknowledgement

I want to acknowledge the team that I worked with to create the application: CJ Pia, Alek Valencia, and Carmen Obied! Amazing collaboration from each person.
